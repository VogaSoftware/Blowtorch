Blowtorch Android
==
So, the release of the ARC Welder has allowed developers to bring their Android based APK apps to the Google Chrome extension containers.
But it's not a perfect system. In fact its far from complete. But we hope to move ARC a little farther with Blowtorch.
With a combination of an custom type of ARC environment we can make it easier for developers to distribute their welded apps without having complex install procedures.


Usage (HOW?!)
--
**THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THE USAGE**

1. With the chrome ARC tool twerk and ARC Welder itself you can first extract the raw un-packaged extension. (The ones that are supposed to be contained by CRX)

2. Once you extract that run the Blowtorch environment for Google Chrome, witch can be downloaded from this repo (see INSTALL) point Blowtorch to your app.

3. Your users can extract your unpackaged extension into the Blowtorch environment themselves to see what you've got goin' on.


Install
--
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

If you can manage to download the unpackaged extension and turn on Chrome/Chromium/Canary Developer Mode you can add Blowtorch.
It is possible that someday we release a CRX-based version you can install from your Extentions drag-n-drop menu.
